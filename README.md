# **Health and Key Indicators Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes health and socioeconomic data to uncover trends in life expectancy, obesity, and smoking rates. Using Python, it features visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to reveal insights on health disparities, correlations, and regional patterns.

## **Key Features**
- **EDA and Diagnostics:**
  - Identified missing data with a heatmap.
  - Summarized key statistics from the datasets.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Histograms for male and female life expectancy.
  - Correlation heatmap for relationships between key indicators.
  - Scatter plot of smoking rates vs. life expectancy (male).
  - Boxplot of obesity levels.
- **Insights:**
  - Negative correlation between smoking rates and male life expectancy.
  - Regional disparities in obesity rates.
  - Consistently higher female life expectancy.
